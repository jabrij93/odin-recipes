# odin-recipes

This is the Odin-Recipes Project. This project is to put into practice the knowledge of HTML and Git Command that I've learned in The Odin Project.
In this project, a basic recipe website is going to be build.

Time taken to complete this project = 3 hours. 
The night before I take a look at the project thought it can finished in less than an hour. The project took longer time than expected due to the translation required from Malay Language to English Language.
